# <Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge>

## Description

As a bootcamp student, I was given a starter code, which had some minor issues included. I resolved the following issues:

-One of the links in the navigation bar did not take the user to any area on the webpage. I added an ID to the correct area of the webpage to fix this issue.
-The source HTML did not include proper HTML semantic terms. In the source HTML I included <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <aside>, and <footer>, so that when a developer reads the HTML, it makes more sense by more closely adhering to conventional HTML semantics.
-The starter code did not include alternative descriptions for images. This poses an issue if a user's browser does not load the image. I included alternative image descriptions to all of the images on the webpage, making the webpage more accessible to users.
-The style sheet included with the starter code was unorganized and contained redundancies. I reorganized the style sheet, included comments, and removed any redundacies. With these changes made, it will be simpler for a developer to maintain and update the webpage throughout its lifetime.
